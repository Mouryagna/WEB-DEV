            An old painter lived in a tiny village where winters were long and harsh. One day, his young neighbor fell terribly ill and whispered, “I’ll die when the last leaf falls from the tree outside my window.”
            <br>
            As autumn passed, leaves dropped one by one. But every morning, one leaf still clung to the branch. She held on to hope—and slowly, she healed.
            <br>
            What she never knew was that the last leaf was a painting, brushed onto the wall by the old man during a stormy night... his final masterpiece.
